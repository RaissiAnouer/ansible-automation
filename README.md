## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaissiAnouer/ansible-automation.git
cd ansible-automation
````

### 2. Install requirements

Ensure Ansible is installed and install the Docker collection:

```bash
pip install ansible
ansible-galaxy collection install community.docker
```

### 3. Configure your inventory

Edit `inventory/hosts.ini`:

```ini
[azure_vm]
<your_vm_ip> ansible_user=adminuser ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### 4. Run the playbooks

#### Step 1: Set up the VM

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/playbook-vm-setup.yml
```

#### Step 2: Deploy the DevOps stack

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/playbook-deploy-stack.yml
```

## 📦 Customization

* Update `docker-compose.yml` to change ports, add volumes, or modify service configurations.
* Add more playbooks for other tools or cloud environments.
* Secure services by integrating Certbot, setting passwords, or enabling firewalls.
